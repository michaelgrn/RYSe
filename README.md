Contained in this repository is code for my thesis, "Why don't you act your age? 
Recognizing the stereotypical 8-12 year old searcher by their search behavior." .
This code is presented primarily in Jupyter Notebooks, with links for any data set 
larger than 20 megabytes found in their respective folders. 

The folders contain code which must be run in the following order:

1. Data
2. FeatureExtraction
3. Experiments
4. Results
