The code in this folder is designed to extract the features from our data sets. The following notebooks can be run in any order:

a. ExtractLexicalFeatures.ipynb

b. ExtractSearchFeatures.ipynb

c. ExtractSpellingAndPunctuation.ipynb

d. ExtractSyntaticalFeatures.ipynb

e. ExtractVocabFeatures.ipynb

but all must be run before running:

FeatureExtractionMain.ipynb

which aggregates the output from all the Extract[featureType].ipynb notebooks.
